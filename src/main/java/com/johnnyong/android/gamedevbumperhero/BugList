If you spawn too many sprites and all of them bunch up, when the hero hits a large amount it
makes all the sprites spaz
If the hero velocity is significantly larger than the monster speed, the monster speed "panic"
can't catch up and pinballs inside of the hero sprite until the hero sprite passes by or the
monster sprite dies
Bosses no work
